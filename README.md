>    <groupId>com.lyx.mappings</groupId>
>    <artifactId>mapbox4j</artifactId>
>    <version>1.0.0</version>
></dependency>
>```
>
>### Gradle
> for oldest versions:
>```groovy
>compileOnly('com.lyx.mappings:mapbox4j:1.0.0')
>```
>for newest versions:
>```groovy
>compileOnly 'com.lyx.mappings:mapbox4j:1.0.0'
